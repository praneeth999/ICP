# Iterative-Closest-Point-ICP-

## Overview
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is an algorithm used to align two sets of points by estimating the transformation (rotation and translation) between them. It iteratively refines the alignment by minimizing the distance between corresponding points in the two sets.
